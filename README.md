## Introduction

ScreenShr is an open-source application that makes it easy for users to create and join parties to share their screens with others. Whether you want to watch a movie, collaborate on a project, or simply connect with friends, ScreenShr simplifies the process, ensuring a hassle-free experience. With no login required, getting started is a breeze.

## Why ScreenShr?

We believe that sharing your screen sometimes can become a burden, especially if it has to be through tools that are intended for other purposes and often require login.
